## Commands

Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Start server:
```sh
# set DEBUG env variable to get debug logs
DEBUG=express-mongoose-es6-rest-api:* npm start
# OR
# requires gulp to be installed globally
npm i -g gulp
gulp serve
```

Execute tests:
```sh
# compile with babel and run tests
npm test (or gulp mocha)

# use --code-coverage-reporter text to get code coverage for each file
gulp mocha --code-coverage-reporter text
```

Other gulp tasks:
```sh
# Wipe out dist and coverage directory
gulp clean

# Lint code with ESLint
gulp lint

# Default task: Wipes out dist and coverage directory. Compiles using babel.
gulp
```

## Logging

Universal logging library [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) is used for logging. It has support for multiple transports.  A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file. We just log to the console for simplicity, you can configure more transports as per your requirement.

#### API logging
Logs detailed info about each api request to console during development.

#### Error logging
Logs stacktrace of error to console along with other details. You should ideally store all error messages persistently.

`npm test` also generates HTML code coverage report in `coverage/` directory. Open `lcov-report/index.html` to view it.
